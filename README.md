# List File(s) And Directory(s)

`lf` is a **simple**, and **fast** file/directory lister with color hightlighting.

<br>

## Install:

This is how to install `lf` from source:

```
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/WestleyR/list-files
cd lf/
make
sudo make install
```

*And yes, lf can be compiled with `tcc` (tiny c compiler) edit in `Makefile`.*
